### Next generation matrix
- Expected number of secondary infections in age group $i$ resulting from contact with an index case in age group $j$:  \newline
$k_{ij} = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} \eta_{i} c_{i,j} (\phi\nu+(1-\phi_{i}))$  
    - $\eta_{i}$ = relative susceptibility of of age group $i$;
    - $\nu$ = relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases.
    - $c_{i,j}$ = average number of daily contacts between a single individual in age group $j$ and all individuals in age group $i$;
- The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is given by the spectral radius $\rho(K)$ = the largest absolute eigenvalue of $K$.
- As $R_{0}$ is specified in the model, the transmission parameter $\beta$ is left as a free parameter that is scaled to the correct value.


### Force of infection
- $\lambda_{i,t+1}$ = force of infection acting on a single individual in age group $i$ at time $t+1$: \newline 
$\lambda_{i,t+1} = \beta \eta_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \frac {c_{i,j}N_{j}} {N_{i}} (\frac {I_{j,t}^{S} + I_{j,t}^{A}\nu} {N_{j}})$
$\lambda_{i,t+1} = \frac {\beta \eta_{i}} {N_{i}} \sum_{j=1}^{M} c_{i,j} ({I_{j,t}^{S}+I_{j,t}^{A}\nu})$
    - $M$ = number of discrete age groups ($M = 15$);
    - $N_{i}$ = population size of age group i.

## Model Assumptions
- Model assumes that individuals are vaccinated and gain immunity at some rate (probability) constnant per age group $\theta_{i}$. 
    - Could make this $f_{t}(...)$? 
- $E^{V}$, $I^{V}$, and $R^{V}$ have their own $F_{t}$ parameters which differ between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. 
- Vaccinated individuals who recover from infection "replenish" their vaccination immunity, *i.e.*, $R^{V}$ flows into $V$.


### No longer sure about these assumptions... 
- $E^{V}$ flows into own $I^{V}$ compartment, allowing adjustment of infectiousness. 
    - Implicitly, vaccination protects against symptomatic and/or asymptomatic disease.
- There end up being two different forces of infection for vaccinated and unvaccinated people: $\lambda^{V}$ and $\lambda^{N}$. It would be better to formulate a more complex expression for $\lambda_{t}$ which accounts for vaccination. 


## Questions to answer
- Are vaccinated individuals less susceptible to infection than non-vaccinated ones? 
- Does vaccinatoin protect against symptomatic disease? (Rather what is the proportion of asymptomatic cases in the infections reported by vaccinated individuals?)
- Do infected vaccinated individuals "replenish" their immunity upon recovery from infection? 
    - Is the effect the same for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases?
- Does vaccination protect against hospitalisation? 
- Do the R boxes contribute to transmission? 

## To do
- Are vaccinated individuals more suscseptible to infection than non-vaccinated, *i.e.* $S^{V}=S$?
    - If $S^{V}\not=S$, then $\lambda^{V}\not=\lambda$. 
    - Then we need to change $\eta_{i}$, the relative susceptibility by age group.
- Vaccine distribution (and therefore immunity) $\sim$ age group. Therefore, immunity will differ by age group. 
    - If immunity differs by age group susceptibility might too. 
- Find **probability** of *asymptomatic case* given *vaccinated infection/case*
- Find **probability** of *hospitalisation* given *symptoamtic vaccinated case/infection* 
    - Oxford paper has plenty of data which might be useful. (Intercept, odds -> probabilities.) 


## Possible angles
- Future of the pandemic i.e. what the winter will look like. 
- Booster shot vs no booster shot ~ impact on transmission 
- Waning immunity vs immune evasion vs increased contact *i.e.* how much vaccinated people transmit Delta? 
  - Implicaions: vaccine passports & booster shots 
- Herd immunity with imperfect vaccination?
